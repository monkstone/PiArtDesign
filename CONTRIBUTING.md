## Creating an Issue

Before creating an issue, please check that there isn't already a similar one in the bug tracking system.

## Small Corrections

Errata and basic clarifications will be accepted if I agree that they improve the content. You can also open an issue so I can figure out how or if it needs to be addressed. If you've never done this before, the [flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) might be useful.

## Large Rewrites

Open an issue for discussion before you start. These changes can be subjective, it might be that you are the sort of person that should write their own book (or become a co-author or get involved with the development of PiCrate).

## Translations

If you would like to contribute to translating the Picrate Book into your language, take a look at [TRANSLATING.md](TRANSLATING.md).
