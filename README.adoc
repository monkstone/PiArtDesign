= PiArtDesign
A guide to writing processing sketches in ruby on RaspberryPI

Welcome to the PiCrate book.

Using Scott Chacon adociidoc https://github.com/progit/progit2 as a template for the book.


== How To Generate the Book (_It doesn't work yet silly, there's no content_, but it will one day)

You can generate the e-book files manually with adociidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at picrate.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at picrate.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at picrate.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF output at picrate.pdf
----
